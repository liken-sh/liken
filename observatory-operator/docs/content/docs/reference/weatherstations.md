# `WeatherStation`

A `WeatherStation` reports the weather at the site and whether it is safe to observe: an INDI device that serves `WEATHER_INTERFACE`. It runs on the observatory's own INDI server, and the `Observatory`'s status reports the worst safety status of its stations.

## spec

One weather station, with INDI's `WEATHER_INTERFACE`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="spec--observatory"></span>`observatory` | string | no | The name of the `Observatory` that the device belongs to. The device runs on the observatory's own INDI server. Optional. With no `observatory`, the device is on the shelf, and the operator creates nothing for it. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9.]*[a-z0-9])?$`. |
| <span id="spec--driver"></span>`driver` | [object](#specdriver) | no | The INDI driver that runs the device. With no `image`, the operator runs the image that the `indi` build lists for the driver, so `name` must then be an INDI driver that the image holds, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`. Set `driver` or `device`, not both. |
| <span id="spec--device"></span>`device` | [object](#specdevice) | no | The resource whose driver serves this device, in place of a driver of its own. INDI puts every interface of one driver on one device, so a camera with a built-in filter wheel serves a `FilterWheel`, and a flat panel with a motorized cover serves a `DustCap`. The resource it names runs the driver, holds the pod, the claim, and the power, and must be on the same INDI server. The operator connects that device before this one's activation, and runs this one's deactivation before that device stops. Set `driver` or `device`, not both. The field cannot change, and a resource that runs a driver cannot gain it: delete the resource and create it again to move it to another device. |
| <span id="spec--power"></span>`power` | [object](#specpower) | no | The `Switch` output that powers the device. Activation switches the output on before the device's pod starts, and deactivation switches it off after the pod stops. Optional. With no power, a person powers the device on and off by hand. |
| <span id="spec--claim"></span>`claim` | object | no | A `ResourceClaimSpec` of the `resource.k8s.io` API, for real hardware. The operator creates a `ResourceClaim` from it for the device's pod. The API server validates it when the operator creates the claim. Optional. A simulator needs no claim. |
| <span id="spec--updateperiod"></span>`updatePeriod` | number | no | How often the driver reads the weather, in seconds. The operator writes it to `WEATHER_UPDATE` once, in the `Configure` step of each reservation. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--parameterlimits"></span>`parameterLimits` | [\[\]object](#specparameterlimits) | no | The limits of each parameter of `parameters`, which the driver defines as a property named for the parameter, such as `WEATHER_TEMPERATURE`. The operator writes each item to the property that the item names once, in the `Configure` step of each reservation. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--activation"></span>`activation` | [\[\]object](#specactivation) | no | The actions that run, in order, as this resource's `Telescope` or `Observatory` turns `Active`, while every device is still connected. For a `Telescope` or an `Observatory`, that is the resource itself. The `Reservation`'s `Activation` step waits for them. Each action is a target state, so a run that an operator restart interrupted runs again each action that is not `Done`. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--deactivation"></span>`deactivation` | [\[\]object](#specdeactivation) | no | The actions that run, in order, as this resource's `Telescope` or `Observatory` stops being `Active`, while every device is still connected. For a `Telescope` or an `Observatory`, that is the resource itself. The `Reservation`'s `Deactivation` step waits for them. Each action is a target state, so a run that an operator restart interrupted runs again each action that is not `Done`. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--triggers"></span>`triggers` | [\[\]object](#spectriggers) | no | Triggers on conditions. Each one runs its actions once for each transition of its condition to the status it names, while the resource is active: from when its activation is done until its deactivation begins. A condition that holds when the activation ends runs then. A run that began runs to its end, unless the resource's deactivation begins, and a resource runs one procedure at a time. Optional. |

### spec.driver

The INDI driver that runs the device. With no `image`, the operator runs the image that the `indi` build lists for the driver, so `name` must then be an INDI driver that the image holds, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`. Set `driver` or `device`, not both.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specdriver--name"></span>`name` | string | yes | The driver's executable, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`. The device's pod runs it under `socat`, so the name holds no path, no space, no comma, and no colon. Pattern: `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.+-]*$`. |
| <span id="specdriver--image"></span>`image` | string | no | The container image that holds the driver, used as written. The image must hold `/usr/bin/socat` and the driver on `PATH`, and must run as user 1000 with a read-only root filesystem and a writable `/tmp`. An image built `FROM ghcr.io/liken-sh/indi` meets all three. Optional. |

### spec.device

The resource whose driver serves this device, in place of a driver of its own. INDI puts every interface of one driver on one device, so a camera with a built-in filter wheel serves a `FilterWheel`, and a flat panel with a motorized cover serves a `DustCap`. The resource it names runs the driver, holds the pod, the claim, and the power, and must be on the same INDI server. The operator connects that device before this one's activation, and runs this one's deactivation before that device stops. Set `driver` or `device`, not both. The field cannot change, and a resource that runs a driver cannot gain it: delete the resource and create it again to move it to another device.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specdevice--kind"></span>`kind` | string | yes | The kind of the resource that runs the driver, such as `Camera`. One of: `Mount`, `Camera`, `FilterWheel`, `Focuser`, `Rotator`, `DustCap`, `FlatPanel`, `PolarAligner`, `GPS`, `Dome`, `WeatherStation`, `Switch`, `Receiver`. |
| <span id="specdevice--name"></span>`name` | string | yes | The name of that resource in this namespace. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9.]*[a-z0-9])?$`. |

### spec.power

The `Switch` output that powers the device. Activation switches the output on before the device's pod starts, and deactivation switches it off after the pod stops. Optional. With no power, a person powers the device on and off by hand.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specpower--switch"></span>`switch` | string | yes | The name of a `Switch` in this namespace. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9.]*[a-z0-9])?$`. |
| <span id="specpower--output"></span>`output` | integer | yes | The number of the output, from 1, as the driver numbers `DIGITAL_OUTPUT_1`. |

### spec.parameterLimits[]

One property of the family, and the values to write to it.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specparameterlimits--name"></span>`name` | string | yes | The property's name, which a member of `WEATHER_PARAMETERS` gives, such as `WEATHER_TEMPERATURE`. |
| <span id="specparameterlimits--minimum"></span>`minimum` | number | no | The least value that is safe, in the unit that the parameter's label names. The member is `MIN_OK`. |
| <span id="specparameterlimits--maximum"></span>`maximum` | number | no | The greatest value that is safe, in the unit that the parameter's label names. The member is `MAX_OK`. |
| <span id="specparameterlimits--warningpercent"></span>`warningPercent` | number | no | How close to a limit a value is a warning, in percent of the safe range. The member is `PERC_WARN`. |
| <span id="specparameterlimits--alertinbounds"></span>`alertInBounds` | number | no | 1 when a value inside the limits is the alert, and 0 when a value outside them is. The member is `ALERT_TYPE`. |

### spec.activation[]

One action, which names `job`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specactivation--job"></span>`job` | [object](#specactivationjob) | no | A container that the operator runs once as a Kubernetes `Job` in the resource's namespace, for what no other action does, such as switching a dew heater's relay or posting to a webhook. The resource owns the `Job`. The action is `Done` when the `Job` succeeds, and `Failed` with the `Job`'s reason and message when it fails. The `Job` has no retry, and its `activeDeadlineSeconds` is the action's timeout. Kubernetes deletes it an hour after it ends. The environment adds `LIKEN_OBSERVATORY`, `LIKEN_TELESCOPE` for a resource of a telescope, `LIKEN_RESOURCE` such as `Dome/lab`, `LIKEN_TRIGGER` such as `activation` or `triggers[0]`, and `INDI_HOST` and `INDI_PORT` of the resource's INDI server. The container runs as user 1000 with no capabilities, on a read-only root filesystem with a writable `/tmp`. The default timeout is 10 minutes. |
| <span id="specactivation--timeout"></span>`timeout` | string | no | How long the action may take, its waits for `requires` and `after` included, as a duration such as `20m`. An action that passes it fails. Optional. Each action has a default. |
| <span id="specactivation--requires"></span>`requires` | [\[\]object](#specactivationrequires) | no | The conditions that must hold before the action runs. The operator waits for each one until the action's timeout. They bind only the actions that the operator runs: a move that a person makes in KStars is stopped only by the drivers' park locks. |
| <span id="specactivation--after"></span>`after` | [\[\]object](#specactivationafter) | no | The resources whose runs for the same event must end before the action runs: the same lifecycle step, or the same transition of the same condition. A resource with no such run is not waited for. A resource in a later tier of the tree is waited for until the action's timeout, and the action then fails. |

## status

What the operator observes. The operator writes it, and a person reads it.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="status--observedgeneration"></span>`observedGeneration` | integer | no | The `metadata.generation` of the spec that the operator last acted on. |
| <span id="status--phase"></span>`phase` | string | no | The device's state in one word. `Inventory`: the device is on the shelf, with no parent, and the operator creates nothing for it. `Idle`: the device is installed, but no reservation of its telescope or its observatory is active, so it has no pod. `Starting`: a reservation's activation began, or the device's pod starts. `Connecting`: the operator asked the driver to connect. `Connected`: the driver reports the device connected. `Disconnecting`: the operator asked the driver to disconnect, or stops the pod. `Error`: a step failed, and the `Ready` condition gives the reason. One of: `Inventory`, `Idle`, `Starting`, `Connecting`, `Connected`, `Disconnecting`, `Error`. |
| <span id="status--conditions"></span>`conditions` | [\[\]object](#statusconditions) | no | `Ready` is `True` while the device is connected. `ParentFound` is `False` when a resource that the spec names, up to the `Observatory`, does not exist, and its message names the missing resource. A device on the shelf names no parent, and its `ParentFound` is `True` with the reason `NoParent`. While a device is connected, it also reports the state that the triggers of procedures read, by kind: a `Dome` `Parked` and `Open` (the shutter), a `Mount` `Parked`, a `DustCap` `Open`, a `FlatPanel` `Lit` (the light), a `Camera` `Cooling` (the cooler), and a `WeatherStation` `Safe`. A park, a shutter, or a cover that moves is `Unknown` with the reason `Moving`. `Safe` is `False` with the reason `Warning` or `Danger`. A device that is not connected has none of them. |
| <span id="status--procedures"></span>`procedures` | [\[\]object](#statusprocedures) | no | The last run of each trigger of the resource's procedures: `activation`, `deactivation`, and `triggers[0]` and so on for each item of `spec.triggers`. An operator that restarts resumes a run from this record. |
| <span id="status--indidevice"></span>`indiDevice` | string | no | The name that the driver gives its device on the INDI server, such as `CCD Simulator`. KStars shows this name. A device that another resource serves names that resource's device. |
| <span id="status--endpoint"></span>`endpoint` | [object](#statusendpoint) | no | The INDI server that runs the device, while the device is installed. A client such as KStars reaches the device at this address by the name in `indiDevice`. |
| <span id="status--driver"></span>`driver` | string | no | The driver that the device's pod runs. A device that another resource serves has no pod of its own. |
| <span id="status--image"></span>`image` | string | no | The image that the device's pod runs, after the operator resolved it. |
| <span id="status--pod"></span>`pod` | string | no | The name of the device's pod, while it exists. |
| <span id="status--node"></span>`node` | string | no | The node that runs the device's pod. |
| <span id="status--limits"></span>`limits` | map[string]map[string]object | no | The range that the driver gives each number of this resource's typed fields that a client can write, by INDI property and then by member, such as `limits.CCD_TEMPERATURE.CCD_TEMPERATURE_VALUE`. Each range has `min` and `max`, the least and the greatest value that the driver accepts, and `step` when the driver states one. The schema describes each typed field, and the driver chooses only these ranges, such as a camera's least and greatest temperature or its range of gain. |
| <span id="status--properties"></span>`properties` | [\[\]object](#statusproperties) | no | Each property of the INDI device that no typed field holds, as the driver defines it, with the values of its last update: a vendor's own properties, the properties that every INDI device has, such as `DEBUG`, and the standard properties of an interface that no resource on the device is, such as the `FILTER_SLOT` of a camera with no `FilterWheel`. Only the resource that runs the driver has the list, so each property is in one object, and no typed reading depends on one. The list holds no BLOB data. |
| <span id="status--updateperiod"></span>`updatePeriod` | [object](#statusupdateperiod) | no | How often the driver reads the weather, in seconds. The status holds what the driver reports in `WEATHER_UPDATE`. `spec.updatePeriod` sets it. |
| <span id="status--refresh"></span>`refresh` | [object](#statusrefresh) | no | Reads the weather again. The status holds what the driver reports in `WEATHER_REFRESH`. Clients such as KStars and Ekos change it. |
| <span id="status--override"></span>`override` | [object](#statusoverride) | no | Reports the weather as safe, whatever the parameters are. The status holds what the driver reports in `WEATHER_OVERRIDE`. Clients such as KStars and Ekos change it. |
| <span id="status--parameterstatus"></span>`parameterStatus` | [object](#statusparameterstatus) | no | The verdict of each critical parameter against its limits. The status holds what the driver reports in `WEATHER_STATUS`. |
| <span id="status--safety"></span>`safety` | [object](#statussafety) | no | The verdict on the whole weather: `Ok` is safe, `Busy` is a warning, `Alert` is danger, and `Idle` is unknown. The status holds what the driver reports in `SAFETY_STATUS`. |
| <span id="status--parameters"></span>`parameters` | [object](#statusparameters) | no | Each weather parameter that the driver reads, such as `WEATHER_TEMPERATURE`, in the unit that its label names. The status holds what the driver reports in `WEATHER_PARAMETERS`. |
| <span id="status--parameterlimits"></span>`parameterLimits` | [\[\]object](#statusparameterlimits) | no | The limits of each parameter of `parameters`, which the driver defines as a property named for the parameter, such as `WEATHER_TEMPERATURE`. The status holds one item for each parameter that `WEATHER_PARAMETERS` names. `spec.parameterLimits` sets it. |
