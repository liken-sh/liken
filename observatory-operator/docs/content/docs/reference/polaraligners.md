# `PolarAligner`

A `PolarAligner` moves a mount's polar axis in altitude and azimuth: an INDI driver with `PAC_INTERFACE`.

## spec

One polar alignment corrector, with INDI's `PAC_INTERFACE`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="spec--telescope"></span>`telescope` | string | no | The name of the `Telescope` that the device belongs to. Optional. With no `telescope`, the device is on the shelf, and the operator creates nothing for it. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9.]*[a-z0-9])?$`. |
| <span id="spec--driver"></span>`driver` | [object](#specdriver) | yes | The INDI driver that runs the device. With no `image`, the operator runs the image that the `indi` build lists for the driver, so `name` must then be an INDI driver that the image holds, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`. |
| <span id="spec--power"></span>`power` | [object](#specpower) | no | The `Switch` output that powers the device. Activation switches the output on before the device's pod starts, and deactivation switches it off after the pod stops. Optional. With no power, a person powers the device on and off by hand. |
| <span id="spec--claim"></span>`claim` | object | no | A `ResourceClaimSpec` of the `resource.k8s.io` API, for real hardware. The operator creates a `ResourceClaim` from it for the device's pod. The API server validates it when the operator creates the claim. Optional. A simulator needs no claim. |
| <span id="spec--activation"></span>`activation` | [\[\]object](#specactivation) | no | The actions that run, in order, as this resource's `Telescope` or `Observatory` turns `Active`, while every device is still connected. For a `Telescope` or an `Observatory`, that is the resource itself. The `Reservation`'s `Activation` step waits for them. Each action is a target state, so a run that an operator restart interrupted runs again each action that is not `Done`. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--deactivation"></span>`deactivation` | [\[\]object](#specdeactivation) | no | The actions that run, in order, as this resource's `Telescope` or `Observatory` stops being `Active`, while every device is still connected. For a `Telescope` or an `Observatory`, that is the resource itself. The `Reservation`'s `Deactivation` step waits for them. Each action is a target state, so a run that an operator restart interrupted runs again each action that is not `Done`. Optional. |
| <span id="spec--triggers"></span>`triggers` | [\[\]object](#spectriggers) | no | Triggers on conditions. Each one runs its actions once for each transition of its condition to the status it names, while the resource is active: from when its activation is done until its deactivation begins. A condition that holds when the activation ends runs then. A run that began runs to its end, unless the resource's deactivation begins, and a resource runs one procedure at a time. Optional. |

### spec.driver

The INDI driver that runs the device. With no `image`, the operator runs the image that the `indi` build lists for the driver, so `name` must then be an INDI driver that the image holds, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specdriver--name"></span>`name` | string | yes | The driver's executable, such as `indi_simulator_ccd`. The device's pod runs it under `socat`, so the name holds no path, no space, no comma, and no colon. Pattern: `^[A-Za-z0-9_][A-Za-z0-9_.+-]*$`. |
| <span id="specdriver--image"></span>`image` | string | no | The container image that holds the driver, used as written. The image must hold `/usr/bin/socat` and the driver on `PATH`, and must run as user 1000 with a read-only root filesystem and a writable `/tmp`. An image built `FROM ghcr.io/liken-sh/indi` meets all three. Optional. |

### spec.power

The `Switch` output that powers the device. Activation switches the output on before the device's pod starts, and deactivation switches it off after the pod stops. Optional. With no power, a person powers the device on and off by hand.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specpower--switch"></span>`switch` | string | yes | The name of a `Switch` in this namespace. Pattern: `^[a-z0-9]([-a-z0-9.]*[a-z0-9])?$`. |
| <span id="specpower--output"></span>`output` | integer | yes | The number of the output, from 1, as the driver numbers `DIGITAL_OUTPUT_1`. |

### spec.activation[]

One action, which names `job`.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="specactivation--job"></span>`job` | [object](#specactivationjob) | no | A container that the operator runs once as a Kubernetes `Job` in the operator's namespace, for what no other action does, such as switching a dew heater's relay or posting to a webhook. The resource owns the `Job`. The action is `Done` when the `Job` succeeds, and `Failed` with the `Job`'s reason and message when it fails. The `Job` has no retry, and its `activeDeadlineSeconds` is the action's timeout. Kubernetes deletes it an hour after it ends. The environment adds `LIKEN_OBSERVATORY`, `LIKEN_TELESCOPE` for a resource of a telescope, `LIKEN_RESOURCE` such as `Dome/lab`, `LIKEN_TRIGGER` such as `activation` or `triggers[0]`, and `INDI_HOST` and `INDI_PORT` of the resource's INDI server. The container runs as user 1000 with no capabilities, on a read-only root filesystem with a writable `/tmp`. The default timeout is 10 minutes. |
| <span id="specactivation--timeout"></span>`timeout` | string | no | How long the action may take, its waits for `requires` and `after` included, as a duration such as `20m`. An action that passes it fails. Optional. Each action has a default. |
| <span id="specactivation--requires"></span>`requires` | [\[\]object](#specactivationrequires) | no | The conditions that must hold before the action runs. The operator waits for each one until the action's timeout. They bind only the actions that the operator runs: a move that a person makes in KStars is stopped only by the drivers' park locks. |
| <span id="specactivation--after"></span>`after` | [\[\]object](#specactivationafter) | no | The resources whose runs for the same event must end before the action runs: the same lifecycle step, or the same transition of the same condition. A resource with no such run is not waited for. A resource in a later tier of the tree is waited for until the action's timeout, and the action then fails. |

## status

What the operator observes. The operator writes it, and a person reads it.

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <span id="status--observedgeneration"></span>`observedGeneration` | integer | no | The `metadata.generation` of the spec that the operator last acted on. |
| <span id="status--phase"></span>`phase` | string | no | The device's state in one word. `Inventory`: the device is on the shelf, with no parent, and the operator creates nothing for it. `Idle`: the device is installed, but no reservation of its telescope or its observatory is active, so it has no pod. `Starting`: a reservation's activation began, or the device's pod starts. `Connecting`: the operator asked the driver to connect. `Connected`: the driver reports the device connected. `Disconnecting`: the operator asked the driver to disconnect, or stops the pod. `Error`: a step failed, and the `Ready` condition gives the reason. One of: `Inventory`, `Idle`, `Starting`, `Connecting`, `Connected`, `Disconnecting`, `Error`. |
| <span id="status--conditions"></span>`conditions` | [\[\]object](#statusconditions) | no | `Ready` is `True` while the device is connected. `ParentFound` is `False` when a resource that the spec names, up to the `Observatory`, does not exist, and its message names the missing resource. A device on the shelf names no parent, and its `ParentFound` is `True` with the reason `NoParent`. While a device is connected, it also reports the state that the triggers of procedures read, by kind: a `Dome` `Parked` and `Open` (the shutter), a `Mount` `Parked`, a `DustCap` `Open`, a `FlatPanel` `Lit` (the light), a `Camera` `Cooling` (the cooler), and a `WeatherStation` `Safe`. A park, a shutter, or a cover that moves is `Unknown` with the reason `Moving`. `Safe` is `False` with the reason `Warning` or `Danger`. A device that is not connected has none of them. |
| <span id="status--procedures"></span>`procedures` | [\[\]object](#statusprocedures) | no | The last run of each trigger of the resource's procedures: `activation`, `deactivation`, and `triggers[0]` and so on for each item of `spec.triggers`. An operator that restarts resumes a run from this record. |
| <span id="status--indidevice"></span>`indiDevice` | string | no | The name that the driver gives its device on the INDI server, such as `CCD Simulator`. KStars shows this name. |
| <span id="status--driver"></span>`driver` | string | no | The driver that the device's pod runs. |
| <span id="status--image"></span>`image` | string | no | The image that the device's pod runs, after the operator resolved it. |
| <span id="status--pod"></span>`pod` | string | no | The name of the device's pod, while it exists. |
| <span id="status--node"></span>`node` | string | no | The node that runs the device's pod. |
| <span id="status--properties"></span>`properties` | [\[\]object](#statusproperties) | no | Every property that the device defines, as the driver defines it, with the values of its last update. A vendor's own properties are here, and no typed reading depends on one. The list holds no BLOB data. |
| <span id="status--readings"></span>`readings` | [object](#statusreadings) | no | What the polar aligner reports, from `PAC_MANUAL_ADJUSTMENT`. A field is absent until the driver sends it. |
